    <h1>Personas & Storyboarding: CSCI 1300 Project 1</h1>
    <p>This is an assignment for CSCI 1300: User Interfaces and User Experience at Brown University.
        Over the course of the assignment, I investigated the usage and accessibility of the 
        pool-table area in the student center at Brown. I was curious if the equipment Interfaces
        were obvious for different types of users (beginner, casual, repeat), and how affordances
        of the space affected the usage and demographics of the users. Below is documentation on
        my preparation, observations, and summaries.
