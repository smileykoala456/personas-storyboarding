        <h1>Personas & Storyboarding: CSCI 1300 Project 1</h1>
        <p>This is an assignment for CSCI 1300: User Interfaces and User Experience at Brown University.
            Over the course of the assignment, I investigated the usage and accessibility of the 
            pool-table area in the student center at Brown. I was curious if the equipment Interfaces
            were obvious for different types of users (beginner, casual, repeat), and how affordances
            of the space affected the usage and demographics of the users. Below is documentation on
            my preparation, observations, and summaries.
        </p>

    <div id="section-1" class="section">
        <h2>Part 1: Preparation</h2>
        <h3>Chosen Interface: Pool area (equipment and user ordering systems)</h3>
        <img src="pool-area.png" alt="A hand-drawn image scan of the labeled pool area"/>
        <p>The pool area space has multiple interactive components. There are two equipment areas: the cue stick 
            rack and the pool tables themselves, which store the balls and the rack on a built-in shelf.
            Additionally, there is an implied social interface of tables nearby where waiting players can stand.
            The equipment interface solves the problem of storing equipment in between user turns and giving
            users access to different equipment options. The cue stick rack works by slotting the pole up through a hole
            and settling it down into a holster. The rack shelf is a hole in the side of the pool table, and the
            balls are stored in a central space that is fed to by the holes in the pool table, below the rack shelf.
        </p>
        <h3>Prepared questions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>How often do you use the pool table area?</li>
            <li>What steps would you take to begin a game?</li>
            <li>Is equipment usually where you expect it to be?</li>
            <li>What steps would you take immediately when a game ends?</li>
            <li>How often do you play with others?</li>
            <li>Do you ever find the tables full when you're trying to use them? How do you approach that situation?</li>
        </ul>

    <div id="section-2" class="section">
        <h2>Part 2: Recording Observations</h2>
        <h3>Observations (10 users)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some users brought their own additional equipment, such as notebooks or special gloves</li>
            <li>Multiple users didn't place their cue sticks into the holster, opting to leave it to the side. 
                Or, between a pair of users, one returned his stick and the other left it on the table. Returns of
                the sticks to their proper storage place was very inconsistent.</li>
            <li>One set of users started the game without using the rack</li>
            <li>All users made sure that the remaining post-game balls were returned to the centralized ball space through the surface holes before leaving</li>
            <li>Multiple pairs of users had one user set up the game while the other waited or talked to observers</li>
            <li>A ratio of 8:1 male:female users used the space</li>
            <li>Multiple users accidentally knocked overhead lamps askew with their poles while playing</li>
            <li>Users who 'properly' put away their sticks ignored other sticks that were laying out near the cue stick rack</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Summarized answers to prepared questions (4 respondents)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>How often do you use the pool table area?
                <ul>
                    <li>One user responded that they use the area every other day, for about 4-5 games a session</li>
                    <li>Other users responded that they very infrequently use the pool table</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What steps would you take to begin a game?
                <ul>
                    <li>All users responded with essentially the same sequence: that they would get cue sticks, set up the balls
                        with the rack, put the rack away, and begin play.</li>
                    <li>These responses followed observed patterns - I did not see the rack left out during gameplay during any of my observation</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Is equipment usually where you expect it to be?
                <ul>
                    <li>Experienced/frequent users noted that yes, equipment was where they needed it to be. None drew attention to the fact that cue 
                        sticks were left both on the table or the rack</li>
                    <li>Less experienced players noted that their first time playing in the pool area, it was difficult to
                        locate the rack because its storage location is not visually obvious.</li>
                    <li>No experienced users noted bringing their own equipment, despite my observation that they did</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What steps would you take immediately when a game ends?
                <ul>
                    <li>All users noted that they would put the cues sticks away</li>
                    <li>This is an interesting observation because in my experience, "putting the cue sticks away" took on multiple forms</li>
                    <li>No users noted that they would return all balls to the centralized area by knocking/pushing them into pockets, despite the fact that I witnessed every single user doing this after a game had concluded.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>How often do you play with others?
                <ul>
                    <li>Casual users noted that they usually played with other people</li>
                    <li>More frequent users noted that they sometimes play alone, but also frequently play with other people</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Do you ever find the tables full when you're trying to use them? How do you approach that situation?
                <ul>
                    <li>All users had noted that they had found tables full when trying to use them before</li>
                    <li>Infrequent users noted multiple responses to this situation: standing on the outskirts of the room until a table opened up, trying to look menacing or intentional to 'give a hint' to those playing that they wanted to use the space, or just leaving when they saw that the tables were occupied</li>
                    <li>More frequent users felt more comfortable approaching current players and asking "can I have next game"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Part 3: Personas</h2>
        <h3>Persona 1: Practicing Paul</h3>
        <p>Paul, a junior, is a frequenter of the Faunce basement pool area - he is a little bit stressed out because he has lots of projects due this week, but is coming for his every-other-day practice, with his special gloves and notebook in tow.</p>
        <p>In terms of the interface, Paul knows exactly where everything is because he's here a lot. However, he feels a sense of entitlement in the space, 
            so he doesn't feel the need to put away his stick when he's done - he doesn't mind when others leave the stick on the table, and the affordances
            of the interface allow him to misuse it in this way.
        </p>
        <img src="practicing-paul.png" alt="An empathy map of Practicing Paul detailing his thoughts and actions"/>
        <p>This persona represents users that I interviewed who exhibited similar behavior: coming for multiple solo games, seeing pool 
            as a hobby, bringing his own equipment, etc.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Persona 2: Casual Cathy</h3>
        <p>Cathy, a first-year, has decided to pop down to the basement for a quick game of pool because she just finished a big academic project with her friends and has time before the club meeting that she is attending. She has played pool before college, but never before in the basement of Faunce.</p>
        <p>In terms of the interface, Cathy struggles to find specific tools, such as the chalk or where the rack is located, but feels a sense 
            of respect for the space, so she and her friends put everything back on the rack.
        </p>
        <img src="casual-cathy.png" alt="An empathy map of Casual Cathy detailing his thoughts and actions"/>
        <p>This persona represents other users that I interviewed, who were more hesitant, intimidated, or indifferent to the space 
            to use it in a way that Paul does.
